        Hello! My name is Robert Salas and I love building things. My interest
        software development began in graduate school where I met some software
        engineers. While collaborating on school projects I took an interest in
        some of their work. It started out as a fun hobby and turned into a
        career to my surprise!
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been fortunate to work with some really great teams and contribute
        to some meaningful projects. My main focus now is building better user
        experiences for Orthofix patients.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some of the technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
