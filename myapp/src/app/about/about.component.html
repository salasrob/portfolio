            Hello! My name is Robert Salas and I love building things. My
            interest software development began in graduate school where I met
            some software engineers. While collaborating on school projects I
            took an interest in some of their work. It started out as a fun
            hobby and turned into a career to my surprise!
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been fortunate to work with some really great teams and
            contribute to some meaningful projects. My main focus now is
            building better user experiences for Orthofix patients.
          </p>

            Here are some of the technologies I've been working with recently:
